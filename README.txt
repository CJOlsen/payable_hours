About:
	Payable Hours is a program for the tracking of clients, projects,
and hours worked.  It is written in Python using wxpython for the GUI and
MySQL for the backend.  It has a simple ORM (object-relational mapping)
system for communicating with the database, which may not be necessary but
makes for a clear layer of abstraction.  

Payable Hours attempts to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) 
design paradigm.

Requires:
	Python 2.7, MySQL and wxpython


I have removed the GPL license for the time being (during development) and will
make final decisions on licensing at a later date.  If you'd like to help 
work on the project let me know and it's very possible that I'll revert the 
license to the GPL.


As always questions, ideas and help are appreciated.
