Project: Payable Hours
Author: Christopher Olsen
License: GNU GPL (see LICENSE.txt)
Version: 0.02 (in development)

About:
	Payable Hours is a program for the tracking of clients, projects,
and hours worked.  It is written in Python using wxpython for the GUI and
MySQL for the backend.  It has a simple ORM (object-relational mapping)
system for communicating with the database, which may not be necessary but
makes for a clear layer of abstraction.  

Payable Hours attempts to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) 
design paradigm.


TODO: * CREATE NEW WXPYTHON INTERFFACE

Requires:
	Python 2.7, MySQL and wxpython


It would be appreciated if the project isn't forked until it's functional,
though the GPL license makes it legal to do so.


As always questions, ideas and help are appreciated.
